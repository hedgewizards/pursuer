# Pursuer: A Tension-focused action webgame
Open-Sourced version of my first itch.io project.
Build with Unity 2021.3.16f1 (2021 LTS)

In its current form, this project does NOT run! and CANT be used for profit

#### It was originally made using the pro version of AstarPathfindingProject https://arongranberg.com/astar/
If you happen to have the pro version astarpathfindingproject, you can just drag and drop it into the right space and it should build fine
I left the folder in its original place in Assets/AstarPathfindingProject/ along with a couple txts to help figure out what version you need

The stock unity pathfinder could probably replace astar pretty cleanly. but I don't have time to do that myself right now. If you end up going
down this route and need help figuring it out (some missing components might be tough to figure out alone) feel free to open a pull request.

#### It contains some assets with unknown licenses
